/**
 *
 * Nose Hoover chain velocity Verlet integrator.
 *
 * This Integrator can be used to simulate systems that include Drude particles. If no Drude particles
 * are present in the system, it thermostats all particles in the system using a single reference temperature.
 * If Drude Particles are present, it applies two different Nose-Hoover chain
 * thermostats to different parts of the system.  The first is applied to ordinary particles (ones that
 * are not part of a Drude particle pair), as well as to the center of mass of each Drude particle pair.
 * A second thermostat, typically with a much lower temperature, is applied to the relative internal
 * displacement of each pair.
 *
 * This integrator can optionally set an upper limit on how far any Drude particle is ever allowed to
 * get from its parent particle.  This can sometimes help to improve stability.  The limit is enforced
 * with a hard wall constraint.
 * 
 * This Integrator requires the System to include a DrudeForce, which it uses to identify the Drude
 * particles.
 * TODO: no requirement of Drude force?!
